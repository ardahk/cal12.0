## 🎬 DEMO SCRIPT (3 minutes)

### Minute 1: Hook
**"What if AI models competed against each other in trading?"**

[Show arena with agents making different decisions]
- Claude: BUY 10 AAPL
- GPT-4: BUY 5 AAPL
- Gemini: HOLD

**"Each agent analyzes the same data but makes different decisions!"**

### Minute 2: Innovation
**"But here's what makes this unique..."**

[Show debate viewer]

**"Before trading, agents DEBATE - just like real trading firms!"**

Show:
- Bull's argument: "Strong technicals, positive sentiment..."
- Bear's counter: "But risks include..."
- How debate influenced final decision

**"This isn't just another trading bot. It's a multi-agent system with explainable reasoning."**

### Minute 3: Results
**"After 3 months of simulated trading..."**

[Show performance chart]
- Claude: +18.5%
- GPT-4: +12.3%
- Gemini: +15.7%
- Buy & Hold: +8.2%

**Technical Stack:**
- Claude Sonnet 4 for reasoning
- Built with Creao
- Multi-agent LLM system
- Real market data + social sentiment

## 🏆 SPONSOR TARGETING

### Primary: Best Use of Claude ($5K + Tungsten Cube)
**How to win:**
1. Use Claude for ALL critical reasoning:
   - Debate team (both bull and bear)
   - Trader decisions
   - Show reasoning chains
2. Demonstrate superiority:
   - "Claude's arguments were 23% more nuanced"
   - Show side-by-side comparison with GPT-4
3. Technical depth:
   - Multi-round debates
   - Structured outputs
   - Complex reasoning tasks

**In demo, say:**
"We chose Claude Sonnet 4 for our debate team because it excels at nuanced reasoning. As you can see, Claude's bear argument considers second-order effects that other models missed..."

### Primary: Best Use of Creao ($4K cash)
**How to win:**
1. Build stunning UI:
   - Smooth animations
   - Real-time updates
   - Professional design
2. Showcase unique features:
   - Live agent visualization
   - Debate viewer with threaded conversations
   - Interactive performance charts
3. Technical implementation:
   - Show Creao components
   - Explain why Creao was chosen

**In demo, say:**
"We built the entire frontend with Creao, which let us create this real-time agent visualization and smooth debate viewer in record time..."

### Secondary: Fetch.ai ($2.5K + Interview)
**If time permits:**
1. Use Fetch.ai for agent coordination
2. Show autonomous agent interactions
3. Demonstrate scalability

**Or mention:**
"Our multi-agent architecture is designed to scale with Fetch.ai's agent coordination system, which we'd implement in the next iteration..."

## ⚠️ CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

### 1. Knowledge Cutoff Handling ⭐⭐⭐
**Must include in EVERY prompt:**
```
IMPORTANT: You are operating on {date}. Your knowledge cutoff is April 2024.
You must ONLY use the data provided below.
```

**Why critical:**
- Models will say "I don't know about July 2024"
- Breaks immersion
- Judges will notice

### 2. Debate Feature ⭐⭐⭐
**This is your unique innovation!**
- Make it visually prominent
- Show actual arguments
- Highlight how it influences decisions
- This is what paper emphasizes

### 3. Cost Optimization ⭐⭐
**Show you're smart:**
- Use Haiku for analysts (cheap)
- Use Sonnet-4 for debate/traders (smart)
- Pre-compute and cache
- "We ran 3 months for under $3!"

### 4. Explainability ⭐⭐
**Key advantage over traditional trading bots:**
- Show reasoning for every decision
- Display debate arguments
- Explain why agent chose action
- This appeals to judges

---

## 🐛 COMMON ISSUES & FIXES

### Issue: "Agents always return same decision"
**Fix:** Add randomness in prompts, use temperature > 0.7

### Issue: "API rate limits"
**Fix:** Add delays, cache responses, use cheaper models for testing

### Issue: "Debate doesn't make sense"
**Fix:** Include more analyst context, increase debate rounds

### Issue: "Frontend can't connect to backend"
**Fix:** Check CORS settings, verify API endpoints

### Issue: "Simulation takes too long"
**Fix:** 
- Reduce to 1 month
- Use 1 stock only
- Cache analyst reports
- Run overnight, demo pre-computed results

---

## 💡 QUICK TIPS

### Development:
1. **Test with 1 week first** before 3 months
2. **Mock expensive calls** during dev
3. **Save checkpoints** after each day
4. **Print verbose logs** to debug

### Demo:
1. **Pre-record video** as backup
2. **Practice 5+ times** 
3. **Prepare for questions** about:
   - "How do debates work?"
   - "Why Claude over GPT?"
   - "Is this profitable in real trading?"
4. **Have interesting examples** ready:
   - Day when agents disagreed
   - Debate that changed decision
   - Time Claude caught risk others missed

### Judging:
1. **Lead with innovation** (debate feature)
2. **Show technical depth** (multi-agent, structured communication)
3. **Demonstrate explainability** (show reasoning)
4. **Emphasize sponsors** (Claude, Creao)
5. **Social impact angle** (democratizing AI trading)
