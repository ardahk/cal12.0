# HACKATHON QUICK START GUIDE - LLM Trading Arena

## üöÄ 3-Day Implementation Plan

### PRE-HACKATHON (Optional)
- [ ] Get API keys (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google AI)
- [ ] Familiarize yourself with the tech stack
- [ ] Read through the main plan document

---

## DAY 1: FOUNDATION & DATA

### Morning (9 AM - 12 PM): Backend Setup
**Goal**: Get a working backend with database

```bash
# 1. Create project structure (15 min)
mkdir llm-trading-arena && cd llm-trading-arena
mkdir backend frontend
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# 2. Install core dependencies (10 min)
pip install fastapi uvicorn sqlalchemy yfinance pandas

# 3. Create basic files (30 min)
# Copy structure from backend_implementation_plan.md
# Start with: main.py, config.py, database/models.py

# 4. Test database creation (5 min)
python
>>> from database.connection import init_db
>>> init_db()
>>> # Should create llm_trading.db file
```

**Deliverable**: Working database schema

### Afternoon (1 PM - 5 PM): Data Collection
**Goal**: Historical data ready for simulation

```bash
# 1. Download market data (45 min)
# Run scripts/download_data.py
# Should have 6 months of data for 5 stocks

# 2. (Optional) Scrape Reddit data (1 hour)
# OR use pre-existing sentiment dataset from Kaggle
# Search for "stock sentiment analysis dataset"

# 3. Format data for agents (30 min)
# Create market_data.py with helper functions
```

**Tips**:
- Start with just AAPL, TSLA, NVDA (3 stocks max)
- Use 1-2 months of data initially (faster to test)
- Skip sentiment data if time is tight - agents can work with just market data

**Deliverable**: historical_prices.json file

### Evening (6 PM - 9 PM): First Agent
**Goal**: One working LLM agent making decisions

```bash
# 1. Implement base agent class (30 min)
# 2. Implement ONE agent (GPT or Claude) (1 hour)
# 3. Test agent decision making (30 min)

# Test command:
python
>>> from agents.gpt_agent import GPTAgent
>>> agent = GPTAgent()
>>> decision = await agent.make_decision({...}, {})
>>> print(decision)
```

**Deliverable**: One agent that returns valid trading decisions

---

## DAY 2: CORE FUNCTIONALITY

### Morning (9 AM - 12 PM): Trading Simulator
**Goal**: Run a complete simulation

```bash
# 1. Implement trading simulator (1.5 hours)
# 2. Add 2 more agents (1 hour)
# 3. Run first simulation (30 min)

# Run simulation:
python scripts/run_simulation.py
# Should see trades happening day by day
```

**Checkpoints**:
- Agents making different decisions
- Trades being executed
- Portfolio values changing
- Data saved to database

**Deliverable**: Completed simulation with results in database

### Afternoon (1 PM - 5 PM): API Endpoints
**Goal**: Working API that frontend can consume

**Priority endpoints** (build in this order):
1. GET /agents - List all agents (30 min)
2. GET /agents/:name - Agent details (45 min)
3. GET /trades/recent - Recent trades (30 min)
4. POST /bets - Place bet (45 min)
5. GET /leaderboard - Rankings (30 min)

```bash
# Start server and test each endpoint
uvicorn main:app --reload

# Test with curl or Postman
curl http://localhost:8000/agents
```

**Deliverable**: All endpoints working and returning correct data

### Evening (6 PM - 9 PM): Frontend Foundation
**Goal**: Dashboard showing agent performance

**Build these components**:
1. Main dashboard layout (1 hour)
2. Agent performance cards (1 hour)
3. Basic performance chart (1 hour)

**Tips**:
- Use a UI component library (Shadcn/ui or Material-UI)
- Start with static mock data
- Connect to API once UI looks good

**Deliverable**: Dashboard displaying agent data

---

## DAY 3: POLISH & DEMO

### Morning (9 AM - 12 PM): Polish & Bug Fixes
**Goal**: Everything works smoothly

**Checklist**:
- [ ] Charts render correctly
- [ ] Real-time updates work
- [ ] Error messages are user-friendly
- [ ] Mobile responsive (at least basic)
- [ ] Loading states everywhere
- [ ] No console errors

**Tips**:
- Test the entire flow multiple times
- Have a friend test it (fresh eyes catch bugs)
- Fix the most critical bugs first

**Deliverable**: Stable, demo-ready app

### Late Afternoon (4 PM - 7 PM): Demo Preparation
**Goal**: Impressive, smooth demo

**Demo Script** (practice this):
```
1. HOOK (30 sec):
   "What if AI agents competed in the stock market?"
   Show dashboard with agents competing

2. EXPLAIN (1 min):
   "Each agent uses a different LLM to analyze market data
    and make trading decisions. Watch how they perform..."
   Show agent detail page with reasoning

3. DEMONSTRATE (1 min):
   "Users can bet on which agent will win"
   Place a bet live
   Show leaderboard

4. RESULTS (30 sec):
   "After 30 days of simulated trading, here are the results..."
   Highlight the winner and interesting insights

5. TECHNICAL (30 sec if asked):
   Briefly explain the tech stack
```

**Prepare**:
- [ ] Pre-run simulation with interesting results
- [ ] Have backup demo if live API fails
- [ ] Prepare 2-3 "wow" moments (e.g., agent reasoning, close competition)
- [ ] Create slides (optional but recommended)
- [ ] Practice demo 3-5 times

**Deliverable**: Confident 3-minute demo

## üî• TIME-SAVING HACKS

### Backend Shortcuts:
1. **Use SQLite** instead of PostgreSQL (easier setup)
2. **Mock 2 agents** if API costs are high (random decisions)
3. **Cache LLM responses** during development
4. **Run simulation once** overnight, use same results for demo
5. **Skip sentiment data** initially, add if time permits

### Frontend Shortcuts:
1. **Use a template** (find a crypto/stock dashboard template)
2. **Copy components** from Shadcn/ui examples
3. **Use mock data first**, connect API later
4. **Skip authentication** (just use a static user ID)
5. **Focus on desktop**, make mobile work later

### Integration Shortcuts:
1. **Test with Postman** before connecting frontend
2. **Use environment variables** for easy config
3. **Have a backup plan** if one agent fails (mock it)
4. **Pre-record demo video** as backup

## üêõ COMMON PITFALLS & SOLUTIONS

### Problem: LLM APIs are slow
**Solution**: 
- Run simulation beforehand, store results
- Use async/await properly
- Show loading states in UI
- Use cheaper models for development

### Problem: Agent decisions are bad
**Solution**:
- Improve prompts (add more context)
- Add safety checks (don't allow invalid trades)
- Use rule-based agents as baseline
- Show reasoning even if decision is "hold"

### Problem: Database queries are slow
**Solution**:
- Add indexes on frequently queried columns
- Limit results (pagination)
- Cache common queries
- Use SQLite for demo (fast for small data)

### Problem: Frontend doesn't update
**Solution**:
- Use React Query for auto-refetching
- Add manual refresh button
- Check CORS settings
- Verify API endpoint is correct

## üé® DESIGN QUICK WINS

Make your demo look professional with minimal effort:

### Colors (Copy-paste ready):
```css
/* Dark theme */
--background: #0f172a;
--card: #1e293b;
--accent: #3b82f6;
--success: #10b981;
--danger: #ef4444;
--warning: #f59e0b;
```

### Fonts:
```html
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter:wght@400;500;600;700&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
```

### UI Tips:
1. Use consistent spacing (multiples of 4px)
2. Add shadows to cards (makes UI pop)
3. Use icons (lucide-react or react-icons)
4. Add hover effects (simple transform)
5. Use gradients sparingly (backgrounds, borders)

---

## üìä DEMO DATA RECOMMENDATIONS

### Ideal Simulation Results for Demo:
- **Close competition** (agents within 5% of each other)
- **One clear strategy difference** (e.g., GPT aggressive, Claude conservative)
- **Interesting trade** to highlight (show reasoning)
- **Comeback story** (agent starts losing, ends winning)

### How to Achieve This:
1. Run simulation multiple times
2. Pick the most interesting run
3. Save that database state
4. Use it for demo
5. Prepare narrative around the results

---

## üé§ PITCH TIPS

### Opening Hook (Choose one):
- "AI is getting smarter, but can it beat the stock market?"
- "We pitted 5 AI models against each other in trading"
- "What if you could bet on which AI is the best trader?"

### Key Talking Points:
1. **Novel application** of LLMs (not just chatbots)
2. **Comparative analysis** (which LLM is best at trading?)
3. **Gamification** (betting makes it engaging)
4. **Educational** (learn about AI capabilities)

### Questions to Prepare For:
- "How did you ensure fairness?" (Same data, capital, rules)
- "Why these LLMs?" (Most popular, different approaches)
- "Is this real money?" (No, simulated for now)
- "What did you learn?" (Have 2-3 insights ready)

## üîß TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE

### If API returns 500 errors:
```bash
# Check logs
uvicorn main:app --reload
# Look for Python stack traces

# Common causes:
# - Missing database table
# - Invalid data type
# - Missing API key
```

### If frontend can't connect:
```javascript
// Check CORS in backend main.py
app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=["http://localhost:3000"],  // Your frontend URL
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)
```

### If agents aren't trading:
```python
# Add debug prints
print(f"Decision: {decision}")
print(f"Agent cash: {agent.cash}")
print(f"Current positions: {agent.positions}")

# Common issues:
# - Insufficient cash
# - Invalid ticker
# - Action is always "HOLD"
```
